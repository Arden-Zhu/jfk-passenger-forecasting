- The merged dataset contains **2,337 daily observations** (Dec 2018 – May
  2025) with 30 columns after joining TSA throughput, NOAA weather, and BTS
  scheduled flights.
- Daily throughput ranges from **1,640** (COVID trough, April 2020) to
  **114,397** (peak summer 2024), with a mean of ~70,000 and a standard
  deviation of ~29,000.
- **Day-of-week seasonality:** Thursday and Sunday are consistently the
  busiest days (travel departure/return days); Tuesday and Wednesday are the
  lowest.
- **Monthly seasonality:** July–August peak; January–February trough.
- **Terminal closures:** Terminal 2 closed ~2023 and Terminal 7 closed ~2024,
  visible in the stacked area chart of terminal-level throughput.
- **Weather correlation:** Temperature shows moderate positive correlation with
  throughput (r ≈ 0.3); snowfall and precipitation are weakly negative.
- **Flight correlation:** Scheduled departure counts are strongly correlated
  with throughput — likely the strongest single predictor available.
- **Passengers per departing flight:** Mean of 111.8 (median 114.5). This ratio
  collapsed to as low as 5.1 during COVID (near-empty planes), then recovered
  to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.
- **COVID-19:** 2020 average throughput dropped to ~25K/day (vs ~90K
  pre-COVID), an 85% decline. Full recovery was reached by 2023–2024. The
  dataset breaks down as: pre-COVID ~430 days (18%), acute collapse ~120 days
  (5%), recovery ~730 days (31%), and post-recovery ~1,060 days (45%).
- **Missing data:** 8 missing dates in TSA data; 2 days without flight data;
  ~1% missing wind speed values — all manageable.
